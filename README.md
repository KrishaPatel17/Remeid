My entry for the Science &amp; Engineering Fair. (The name is supposed to be a cross between the words remind &amp; medication)
This will be a ongoing project that I will over time add onto as there are a lot of bugs to fix so there will be updates time to time. If you see a problem or something I should add please reach out to me or file an issue! 

To view or use you must download the file and then upload it into MIT App Inventor (https://appinventor.mit.edu/).

Thanks for using!

Version 1: First draft for the project. 

Version 2: Fixed the 'save' button as if you exited the app the medication names would become erased. Now they are saved onto the database. I have also added a 'delete' button in case you accidentally add something you did not want.
